    <p class="lead">A non-pneumatic lattice replaces tubes and pressure checks with engineered resilience. Here’s how we deliver flats-free riding without sacrificing feel.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Split: Lattice design -->
  <section class="split">
    <div class="content prose">
      <h2>Lattice tuned for ride feel</h2>
      <p>Instead of air pressure, a repeating cell network carries load and returns energy. Cell size, wall thickness, and orientation are varied across the cross-section to shape the “spring curve” you experience on the road. Small bumps disappear into the structure; bigger hits are spread over more material to avoid harsh spikes.</p>
      <p>The contact patch stays consistent as forces ramp up, which is why cornering feels natural and braking stays predictable. You get the control you expect from good pneumatic setups, minus the maintenance penalty.</p>

  <!-- Split: Impact resilience -->
  <section class="split flip">
    <div class="visual"><img src="assets/img/airless-city.jpg" alt="Airless tire technology in urban commute"></div>
    <div class="content prose">
      <h2>Impact routing & puncture resistance</h2>
      <p>We map high-risk impact paths and reinforce those trajectories with thicker members and alternate load routes. When a sharp object contacts the tread, energy distributes through neighboring cells rather than rupturing a fragile air chamber. The result: flats that would end a ride on tubes now become non-events.</p>
      <p>Because the structure is continuous, there’s no valve or bead blowout failure mode. Your ride quality remains stable from Monday to Sunday.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Split: Materials & lifecycle -->
  <section class="split">
    <div class="content prose">
      <h2>Materials, wear, and sustainability</h2>
      <p>We pair an abrasion-resistant outer layer with a supportive sub-lattice. Compounds are chosen for wet grip and longevity, and the architecture limits hysteresis so rolling resistance stays reasonable for commuting speeds.</p>
      <p>Lifecycle matters just as much as day-one feel. Fewer replacements mean fewer shipments and less packaging. Components are designed with recyclability in mind to reduce end-of-life impact.</p>

  <!-- Deep technical dive (long-form SEO) -->
  <section class="card prose">
    <h2>Deep technical dive: stability and control</h2>
    <p><strong>Cornering stability:</strong> The lattice keeps lateral stiffness high near the sidewalls and slightly softer at the crown. That distribution keeps steering precise without feeling wooden. In crosswinds, the footprint remains planted so you can hold a line through gusts and uneven pavement.</p>
    <p><strong>Braking feel:</strong> Under deceleration, load moves forward. Our geometry increases support where the patch elongates, maintaining grip without abrupt squirm.</p>
    <p><strong>Thermal behavior:</strong> Without a sealed air chamber, small thermal swings don’t change pressure or feel. The structure’s response stays consistent across the morning chill and afternoon heat.</p>
    <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> No inflation. Keep the tread clean, inspect periodically, and ride. Most riders report fewer interruptions and more total miles per month.</p>
